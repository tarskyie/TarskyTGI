TarskyTGI - like TarskyieTGUI but not really, it's different.

Built with WinUI 3 and Windows 11 design in mind... and proudness!! Advanced technology included ðŸ˜Ž

To build YOURSELF:
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 and WinUI 3 tools and C++ stuff too
2. build it unpackaged
3. Done
4. That's it
5. Oh, forgor that you also need VS C++ and Python to install llama-cpp-python
6. Now that's IT!
